# Resolve `isaacteleop_examples.teleop_ros2` against the in-tree source, so a
# bare `pytest` works and the ctest ENVIRONMENT needs no example path.
#
# These files are also copied into the teleop_ros2 container
# (Dockerfile: `COPY tests/python/examples/teleop_ros2/ tests/`), where
# tests/python/repo_paths.py does not exist and the example is already installed
# into the venv by `uv sync`. So the source-tree wiring is conditional: without
# it, importing repo_paths raises and every test errors during collection.
