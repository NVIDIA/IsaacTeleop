/*
 * General documentation for the XR_NVX1_tensor_data extension:
 *
 * This extension provides a generic interface for streaming tensor data from
 * OpenXR runtimes to applications. It enables runtimes to expose various types
 * of data (sensor readings, ML inference results, tracking data, etc.) in a
 * standardized tensor format that applications can discover and consume.
 *
 * Key concepts:
 * - Tensor List: A versioned list of tensor collections available from the runtime.
 *   The list has a generation number that increments when collections are added or
 *   removed, allowing applications to detect when their cached view is stale.
 *
 * - Tensor Collections: Each entry in the tensor list is a collection that can
 *   contain one or more individual tensors. Collections have metadata like
 *   identifiers, UUIDs, and total byte size.
 *
 * - Individual Tensors: Each tensor within a collection has its own properties
 *   including data type, size, offset within the collection, and identifier.
 *   Applications query these properties to understand the data format.
 *
 * - Sample Retrieval: Applications retrieve data samples per collection (containing
 *   all tensors). Samples can be retrieved individually or in batches. Each sample
 *   includes timing metadata (device timestamp, arrival timestamp, sample index).
 *
 * - Data Types: Supports element tensors (numeric arrays), DLPack tensors
 *   (for ML framework interoperability), and extensible future types.
 *
 * Typical usage flow:
 * 1. Query system for tensor data support
 * 2. Create a tensor list from the session
 * 3. Query list properties to discover available tensor collections
 * 4. Query collection properties for each entry in the list
 * 5. Query individual tensor properties within each collection
 * 6. Retrieve tensor collection data samples (single or batch)
 * 7. Call xrGetTensorListLatestGenerationNV to get the latest generation number
 *    and compare it to the generation number of the cached list.
 * 8. If the generation number is different, update with xrUpdateTensorListNV.
 * 9. If the generation number is the same, the cached list is still valid.
 *
 * The extension is designed for real-time streaming with timing metadata that
 * acknowledges clock drift and network latency, while also providing raw device
 * timestamps for offline post-processing scenarios.
