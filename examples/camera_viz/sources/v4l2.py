"""V4L2 (UVC webcam) source for camera_viz.

Drives any V4L2-compatible device via OpenCV's V4L2 backend. The hot
path is: ``cap.read()`` into pinned host memory → async ``cudaMemcpy``
into a pre-allocated GPU BGR landing buffer → GPU BGR→RGBA channel
reverse into the RGBA output buffer. Everything pre-allocated; no
per-frame allocation.

CAP_PROP_BUFFERSIZE is forced to 1 so the kernel-side V4L2 buffer
doesn't queue stale frames — the consumer always sees the latest
captured frame, not whatever sat in the queue since the last grab.

Hardware-decoded MJPG via NVDEC isn't in scope here; if you need
sub-millisecond decode at 4K, replace the OpenCV backend with a
PyNvVideoCodec-based source.
