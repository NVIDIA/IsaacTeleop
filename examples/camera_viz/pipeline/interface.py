    CUDA stream so the consumer can synchronize when it's not 0/default.

    Stereo: ``image`` is the left eye; ``image_right`` carries the
    right eye when paired (both from the same capture instant).

    ``image`` may be *borrowed* rather than owned: a source is allowed to
    hand back a view onto memory it will reuse (``cuda_ipc`` maps producer
    memory directly). A borrowed frame stays valid only until the next
    ``latest()`` on the source that produced it, so a consumer must finish
    reading — or copy — before polling again, and must not retain a Frame
    across polls. ``ImageLayerBase::submit`` upholds this by synchronizing
    its copy before returning; keep that guarantee if you change it.
