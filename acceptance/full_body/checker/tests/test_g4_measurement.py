"""G4 is judged by how accurately it measures, not by whether it passes.

The graded fixtures carry the exact injected magnitude in the index, and they exist so
the measurement can be built before anyone knows where the threshold belongs. So these
tests assert two things a threshold cannot give: that the measured value recovers the
injected one, and that the series stays ordered. A check that reported a constant would
satisfy a pass/fail oracle on these fixtures and fail here.
