# Full-body device acceptance checker

Decides whether a third-party full-body motion-capture integration works, from one MCAP
recording of a prescribed motion script and nothing else. It runs 38 checks over the
recording and returns one verdict:

| Verdict | Exit status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `pass` | 0 | Nothing in the recording argues against the integration. |
| `fail` | 1 | An acceptance failure attributable to the device or its plugin. |
| `retake` | 2 | The capture is unusable because of how it was performed. The device is not implicated. |
| `insufficient_data` | 3 | The recording cannot answer the question — too short, no skeleton in it, or a prerequisite check failed. |

`fail` and `retake` are deliberately separate. Telling a vendor their device is broken
when the operator simply squatted too shallow is the specific mistake this process exists
to avoid.

The checker is a pure addition to the repository: it imports no `isaacteleop` package and
the only thing it takes from the tree is the FlatBuffers schema text under
`src/core/schema/fbs/`. Design rationale, the measurements behind every threshold, and
the open questions live in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Set up

```bash
cd acceptance/full_body/checker
./setup_env.sh
```

Needs `uv`, `curl` and `unzip` on a Linux or macOS host. The script builds `.venv`,
fetches **flatc v24.3.25** into `toolchain/`, generates the Python bindings into
`generated/`, and verifies that the `.bfbs` it produces is byte-identical to
`src/core/schema/golden/full_body.bfbs` — the schema bytes a real recording embeds. Run
it again after the schema changes; it is idempotent and writes nothing outside this
directory.

## Record a take

[`../capture/README.md`](../capture/README.md) is the step-by-step, including what the
performer does and what to do when it goes wrong. Recording is **Linux only** — it
drives the device through Isaac Teleop — while everything above and below this section
runs on macOS too. In outline: the capture side has its own venv, built once on a
machine with the project built:

```bash
acceptance/full_body/capture/setup_env.sh    # after this checker's setup_env.sh
acceptance/full_body/capture/record.sh pico4u
```

One take of the ten-step motion script, in a viser panel on <http://localhost:8081>.
Recording starts when you press **Start recording**, and each step then waits for the
performer: the cue is spoken and shown, and the window opens on a controller trigger or
the space bar and closes on that step's own length. So the take has no fixed duration,
and both ends of the file are clean because nothing useless was ever written. It writes

```text
~/isaacteleop-captures/<device>/<date>/<time>-g4.mcap
                                      /<time>-g4.labels.json   motion-step windows
                                      /<time>-g4.log
                                      /<time>-g4.json          what produced it
```

Nothing is ever overwritten, so run it again for another take. The spoken cues are WAV
files in `acceptance/full_body/capture/cues/` and need no synthesiser, so `aplay` is the
only other thing the panel wants.

The label sidecar carries the motion windows the G4 checks read, and the panel writes it
once the file is closed: each window is a pair of record numbers observed as the presses
happened, resolved against `sample_time_local_common_clock` in the finished recording.
Windows no longer tile — the performer moving between poses falls outside all of them.
Each one records whether a trigger or the keyboard opened it, since only a trigger leaves
a trace in the recording to cross-check against. They are still marked provisional,
because the labels are a sidecar rather than a channel in the MCAP.

The trigger and the keyboard are equals, not a primary and a fallback: with two people
the one at the screen does the pressing, and a mocap suit has no controllers at all.

If the client reports `body_tracking: false`, every joint arrives invalid and only the
container and envelope checks can run. On PICO that is a browser limitation, not a
hardware or licensing one — see `AGENTS.md`.

## Run the checks

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m full_body_acceptance.cli \
    ~/isaacteleop-captures/<device>/<date>/<time>-g4.mcap
```

Spell the recording out. There is no `latest` alias, and making one defeats the next
paragraph: a symlink or a copied-elsewhere `.mcap` has no `.labels.json` beside *it*, so
every G4 check goes unanswered and the verdict reads `pass` instead of `retake`.

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--json` | Machine-readable report: per-check status, severity, attribution, and every measurement. |
| `--check NAME` | Run only this check. Repeatable. |
| `--labels SIDECAR` | Use these motion labels instead of `RECORDING.labels.json` beside the file. |
| `--list-checks` | Print the check names with their severities and one-line summaries. |

Labels are optional. Without them the G4 window measurements report that they could not
be answered, and the envelope and geometry checks still run.

## Read the report

```text
verdict  RETAKE

  [pass] rate.interval_regularity                 56.1 Hz, jitter 0.14 ms
  [meas] posture.tpose_arm_droop                  arms -3.8 deg below horizontal ...
  [FAIL] posture.squat_knee_symmetry              the knees differ by 21.4 deg ...
  [n/a ] posture.march_ankle_antiphase            not judged: ... failed, so this ...
```

| Mark | What it means |
|---|---|
| `pass` | The check was answered and the answer is acceptable. |
| `FAIL` | The check was answered and the answer is not. Whether that makes the verdict `fail` or `retake` depends on whom the check blames. |
| `meas` | A number was measured and **nobody judged it.** These checks have no threshold yet, because the threshold has to come from real subjects rather than from test fixtures. Read the value; do not read it as approval. |
| `n/a ` | Not answered. Either there was not enough data, or a check this one depends on failed, which makes the measurement describe the wrong frames. A suppressed check never becomes a pass. |
| `note` | An advisory check failed. Reported, but it does not move the verdict — these are cases where a hard failure would reject legitimate hardware. |

## View a take

```bash
./setup_env.sh --panel     # once; installs viser, the panel's renderer
.venv/bin/python -m full_body_acceptance.panel \
    ~/isaacteleop-captures/<device>/<date>/<time>-g4.mcap
```

Prints the same report, then serves a panel on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. It takes
`--labels`, and `--host` / `--port` for reaching it from another machine. It shows the
things a list of 38 lines cannot:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Skeleton, coloured per joint** | A live joint is green. A joint whose `is_valid` went false is drawn **red at the position it was last seen**, and named in the scene — its recorded position is arbitrary, so it is not drawn where the file says. This is the view in which a hand dropping out as the subject turns is obvious. |
| **Frame rate, scrolling** | A dropped block is a spike here. In the text report it is a slightly lower mean. |
| **Valid joints over the whole take** | A decay is one glance, rather than a start-and-end pair of percentages. |
| **Three groups of checks** | Named after what they read — the envelope and signal, the skeleton's geometry, the posture over the labelled windows. Each carries its own answer before you expand it, worst result first, with the few checks that decide the take pulled out above them. The gate numbering below is the submitter's narrative and the panel does not show it. |

`play` runs the take at its own rate; `speed` and the `frame` scrubber move the
playhead. The list always shows the **final** result of every check: three of them need
the whole recording by construction, so a result taken mid-playback would be a number
with no meaning.

viser is an optional extra, and only the panel's renderer uses it. Without `--panel` the
checker runs exactly as before, on `mcap` and `flatbuffers` alone.

## Send a take

**`package for submission`** in the panel builds one archive and downloads it through the
browser — so it lands on the machine you will send it from, even when the panel is being
viewed over `--host`. Right-click the link it offers for *Save as…* to choose where.

```text

    ├── report.json                  verdict, checks, groups, per-frame series,

    └── 145511-g4.log                recorder log
```

The take name alone is a time of day, which repeats every day and collides outright
between two devices recording at once, so the device and date come from the capture
sidecar — or from the `<device>/<date>/` layout when that sidecar is missing.

4.5 MB and a fifth of a second for a 102 s take. `report.json` is a superset of `--json`
and reads out of the archive without decompressing the recording, so a dashboard needs
only that member. Each check in it carries its **`mark`** and its group, so nothing
reading the file has to reimplement how a result is displayed or how the verdict is
reached.

The recording and its sidecars are the evidence; the packed report is a convenience. The
checker is deterministic, so re-running it on the archive reproduces the verdict exactly
— at the same commit, which is why `tool.commit` is in there. **The labels sidecar cannot
be regenerated** from the recording: without it every G4 check reports unanswered and the
verdict changes, which is why the archive holds more than one file. A companion that was
never there is not an error; `inputs.missing` names it.

## The seven gates

The acceptance process has seven gates. The checks in this directory carry the gate
label they belong to, which `--json` reports and `--list-checks` prints.

| Gate | Tests | Here |
|---|---|---|
| G0 | Build & skip — the plugin builds, and skips cleanly when its SDK is absent. | Attested by the submitter; not checked from a recording. |
| G1 | Schema & channel conformance — the right schema, channel, timestamps, finite values, unit quaternions, a pose on every record. | Implemented, `gate: G1`. |
| G2 | Skeleton geometry — up axis, metres, handedness, bone-length constancy, human proportions, left/right labelling, joint indexing, quaternion component order, position/orientation agreement. | Implemented, `gate: G2`. |
| G3 | Signal quality — frame rate and its jitter, dropouts, validity trend, plausible joint speed. | Implemented; those checks report under `gate: G1`. |
| G4 | Posture semantics — over the reviewer's motion windows: was each step performed, in order, and does each joint angle read what the pose implies. | Implemented, `gate: G4`. |
| G5 | Replay through retargeting — the recording drives a robot end to end. | Not implemented, and further off than it reads: no retargeter in this repository consumes `full_body`, so the human-skeleton-to-robot mapping this gate would exercise does not exist yet. See `AGENTS.md`. |
| G6 | Human review — a reviewer watches the video of the same session. | Not automated by design. |

## Tests

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
```

Two layers. The unit layer feeds accumulators frames built in memory and runs from a
fresh clone. The oracle layer is parametrised over the synthetic fixture set's
`fixtures_index.json` and skips when that set is not present; point `FULLBODY_FIXTURES`
at it if it lives somewhere other than `design_agent-testing/synthetic-fixtures`.

## Layout

```text
src/full_body_acceptance/
  frames.py        Frame / JointPose / SourceMetadata, and the FrameSource protocol
  mcap_source.py   reads an MCAP in file order, never in log-time order
  labels.py        the motion-window sidecar
  profile.py       skeleton profile: topology, symmetry, priors, which checks apply
  checks/          one module per check group; base.py holds the accumulator contract
  report.py        verdict aggregation, dependency suppression, JSON and text renderers
  cli.py           python -m full_body_acceptance.cli
  panel/           the viewer; app.py is the only module that imports viser
tests/
  synth.py               builds MCAPs in memory
  known_deviations.py    where this checker knowingly disagrees with the fixture index
