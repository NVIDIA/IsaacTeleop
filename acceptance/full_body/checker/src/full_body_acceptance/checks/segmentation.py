"""Whether the labels can be trusted before anything is measured through them.

Every G4 measurement reads the recording through the reviewer's windows, so a
mislabelled session produces confident numbers about the wrong frames. These checks run
first in spirit: they ask whether the windows are well formed, aligned with the frames
they claim, and describing motion that actually happened in the order claimed.

The motion tests here deliberately look only for gross presence and ordering. Anything
finer would start inferring the segmentation from the data, and the windows exist
precisely so that measurement does not have to.
