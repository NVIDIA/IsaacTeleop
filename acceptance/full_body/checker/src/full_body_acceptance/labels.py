"""The reviewer's motion-step labels, and the timeline the G4 checks read them through.

Windows are marked by hand in the script's order, never inferred from the data. Deriving
them from the data is circular: a segmenter that saw the right hip move would label the
window "right leg raise" and absorb a left/right swap as context, so the one fault that
only a single-limb motion can reveal would be defined away.

Labels live in a sidecar JSON beside the recording because the in-recording annotation
channel does not exist yet, and they are timed in ``sample_time_local_common_clock``.
