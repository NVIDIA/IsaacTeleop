# oracle/

Recordings whose correct verdict is already known, and the generators that build them.
This is what [the checker](../checker/README.md) is tested against: 55 synthetic MCAP
files, each one either correct or carrying exactly one injected fault, plus
`fixtures_index.json` saying what each of them should make the checker say.

## Building the set

```bash
../checker/setup_env.sh    # once per clone
./generate.sh
```

`generate.sh` writes `fixtures/`, reads every file back and checks it against the
index — about 50 seconds in total. There is no setup step and no venv of its own: the
checker's `setup_env.sh` already pins flatc v24.3.25 and proves its `.bfbs`
byte-identical to `src/core/schema/golden/full_body.bfbs`, and the fixtures embed those
same bytes.

**The recordings are not in git and the index is.** They are 67 MB of derived data that
regenerates byte-identically from the committed generators, so the index is the part
worth versioning. A generator change that moves a byte therefore shows up as a dirty
`fixtures_index.json`, which `generate.sh` refuses to leave unreviewed.

Until you have run it, 26 of the checker's tests skip, each naming this script. The rest
of its suite runs from a fresh clone and needs nothing from here.

## The index is the contract

Every fixture carries an `expected_verdict`, and the four values are not
interchangeable:

| Verdict | Meaning for the checker |
|---|---|
| `pass` | Must be accepted. Includes the `benign` category — unusual but correct. |
| `fail` | Acceptance failure **attributable to the device or integration**. |
| `retake` | Capture unusable because of **human performance**. The device is not implicated. |
| `graded` | A known magnitude is injected. There is no threshold yet, so the oracle is the *measured value*, not a verdict. |

A checker that collapses `fail` and `retake` into one outcome is wrong even when it
flags the right files. Telling a vendor their device is broken when their operator
simply squatted too shallow is the specific failure this distinction exists to prevent.

Per fixture the index gives `filename`, `batch`, `category`, `expected_verdict`,
`description`, frame count and size; for defects `expected_failing_check`; for G4
additionally `kind`, `labels_sidecar` and, for the graded series, `injected` with the
exact magnitude and its unit.

## What is in the set

**Batch 1 — envelope (`fixtures/`), 27 files.** Three categories, and the third is the
point of the exercise.

*Golden — must pass.* A clean 14 s @ 60 Hz scripted sequence (A-pose still, T-pose hold,
single-arm raise, single-leg raise, return to T-pose) plus a 6 s static T-pose baseline.

*Benign — unusual but correct, must also pass.* These are the false-positive guards, and
they exist because a naively written checker fails a working vendor:
`benign_invalid_joints_zero_pose` (joints the vendor does not provide carry an all-zero
pose with `is_valid=false`, exactly what `make_invalid_body_joint_pose()` emits in
`src/plugins/noitom_mocap/`), `benign_backfilled_endpoints` (hands and feet derived from
wrists and ankles and marked valid, so four bones have a constantly zero length), and
`benign_dropout_recovery` (a limb goes invalid for a second and comes back). Without
this category, "does the checker catch things" and "does the checker only catch real
things" are not separable, and a checker that fails everything scores perfectly.

*Defects — exactly one injected fault each.* Geometry and frame faults (Z-up,
centimetres, left/right swap, `w,x,y,z` quaternions, mirrored handedness, positions
rotated but not orientations, permuted indices, drifting bone lengths, impossible
proportions, teleport), record and envelope faults (NaN/Inf, non-unit quaternions,
absent `joints`, non-monotonic timestamps, device clock copying the common clock,
`available` before `sample`, bulk null payloads, `all_joint_poses_tracked` contradicting
the per-joint flags) and rate faults (jitter, dropped frames, degrading validity). Each
changes exactly one thing, so a failure maps to one cause.

**Batch 2 — G4 posture semantics (`fixtures/g4/`), 28 files.** The eleven-step script at
50 Hz for 41 s — 60 Hz would push each file past pre-commit's 2000 KiB limit. Each MCAP
has a `<name>.labels.json` beside it giving every step's window in the same clock domain
as the record timestamps. **The sidecar is provisional**: there is no in-recording
annotation channel yet, and the labels are expected to move into the recording once that
design lands.

The G4 fixtures are tagged `kind`, because two different things can be wrong:
`device_fault` (good performance, broken device — march ankles in phase, squat reps not
matching, asymmetric knees through an even squat, an arm raise that saturates) and
`performance_fault` (working device, bad execution — a squat too shallow to measure, a
slow irregular march, leaning while raising an arm, a step skipped, steps out of order).
`g4_verify.py` prints, for each performance fixture, the measurement that keeps it
distinguishable from the corresponding device fault.

Four quantities come as graded series with the magnitude recorded numerically, so the
measurement can be built now and a threshold dropped in later: cumulative drift (0, 0.02,
0.05, 0.15 rad), contralateral cross-talk (0, 2, 10, 25°), T-pose arm droop (0, 5, 15,
30°) and T-pose left/right asymmetry (0, 3, 10°). Assert that the measured value tracks
the injected one — accurate and monotonic — not pass or fail. The generator currently
reproduces all four to within 0.13 of a unit.

## On the wire

Pinned to `src/core/mcap/cpp/inc/mcap/tracker_channels.hpp` and
`src/core/deviceio_session/cpp/deviceio_session.cpp`, so a checker cannot tell these
apart from a real recording by envelope:

| | |
|---|---|
| MCAP schema name | `core.FullBodyPoseRecord` |
| schema encoding / data | `flatbuffer` / the `.bfbs` bytes |
| topic | `full_body/full_body` |
| message encoding | `flatbuffer` |
| `logTime` = `publishTime` | `available_time_local_common_clock` |
| `sequence` | increments from 0 |
| profile / compression | `teleop` / none |

Conventions in the data: right-handed, **Y-up**, metres, quaternions **(x, y, z, w)**,
subject facing **−Z** so `RIGHT_*` joints sit at +X. Joint indices come from the
`BodyJoint` enum in `full_body.fbs`; each joint's parent comes from the 24-joint table in
`docs/source/device/body_tracking.rst`.

## Files

```text
skeleton.py           joint layout, FK, quaternion maths, envelope-batch animation
g4_script.py          the eleven-step G4 motion script + injectable magnitudes
mcap_io.py            FlatBuffer encode + MCAP write, pinned to the C++ writer
toolchain.py          where the checker's flatc output is
generate_fixtures.py  envelope-batch registry; drives both batches
g4_fixtures.py        G4-batch registry
verify_fixtures.py    reads the envelope batch back and asserts every claim
g4_verify.py          measures the G4 batch back against the injected truth
fixtures_index.json   the oracle
```

## Adding a fixture

Regenerate, never hand-edit: the files are derived, and a defect added as a
transformation composes with everything else. Envelope batch, in
`generate_fixtures.py`:

```python
@fixture("defect_my_fault", DEFECT, "one line", verdict="fail", check="group.check_name")
def _my_fault(rec):
    for f, i, j in each_joint(rec):
        ...            # mutate in place
```

G4 batch: add a field with a numeric magnitude to `PostureParams` in `g4_script.py`, use
it in `g4_local_rotations`, and add one `G4Fixture(...)` entry in `g4_fixtures.py`. A
graded series is a loop over values, not a set of files.

Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) before changing a generator. It records what this set can
and cannot establish, which is the part that is easy to get wrong.
