"""Writes the G4 label sidecar from the windows the panel recorded.

The panel knows each window as a pair of record numbers, because a live ``FullBodyPose``
carries no timestamp at all. This opens the finished recording **read-only**, reads
``sample_time_local_common_clock`` off those records, and writes the sidecar the checker
loads beside the file.

Nothing here searches the data for the motion. The boundaries are events that were
recorded as they happened, so the only arithmetic left is the frame-to-timestamp lookup
-- and it is auditable, because the frame numbers go into the sidecar beside the times
they resolved to.

``verify()`` stays, with a changed job. It used to catch an anchor dropped on the wrong
part of the recording; it now catches a step pressed at the wrong moment or performed
wrongly. Seven of the ten steps have a criterion that reads a signal the press did not.
