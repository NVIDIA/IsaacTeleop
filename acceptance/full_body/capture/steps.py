"""The step loop: cue the pose, wait for the performer, hold for the step's own length.

No viser, no isaacteleop, no audio and no clock of its own. ``advance()`` and
``press()`` say *what to play* and the caller plays it, which is what lets
``tests/test_steps.py`` drive a whole take in memory -- the only place the swallow rule
below is actually asserted.

Boundaries are recorded as record numbers, not times. A live ``FullBodyPose`` carries no
timestamp, so the panel counts the records it watched the recorder write and
``make_labels.py`` converts those numbers afterwards.
