"""G4 posture measurements over the reviewer's labelled motion windows.

Everything here measures a *local* joint angle, recovered as
``conj(q_parent) * q_child`` projected onto the body axis the motion turns about. Local
angles are what a vendor's integration actually gets wrong, and unlike world-frame
distances they do not move when the subject stands somewhere else in the room: a
world-frame measurement turns a retake into a fail, which is the confusion G4 exists to
prevent.

The graded checks are advisory. They report a number whose threshold is a calibration
question that no synthetic fixture can answer -- how much droop is too much depends on
real subjects -- and the fixture index marks those recordings "graded" rather than pass
or fail for the same reason. The fault checks do carry thresholds, each placed in the
middle of a gap that the fixture corpus leaves empty rather than tuned to a number.
