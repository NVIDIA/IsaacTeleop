"""The accumulator contract.

Checks are incremental (``update(frame)`` / ``result()``) so one implementation serves a
live session, an MCAP file and a replay session.

Measurement and policy are separate: an accumulator reports a status and its
measurements, while ``severity`` is declared on the class and ``attribution`` defaults there
consumed by verdict aggregation. A threshold can then be filled in without touching a
measurement.
