"""Run the CloudXR service detached from the calling terminal.

``start_new_session=True`` is ``setsid(2)``: the child leads its own session,
so it has no controlling terminal and neither a hangup nor a signal aimed at
the shell's process group can reach it.  Works the same on a host, in a
container, and under CI — nothing here needs systemd.

What it does not do is supervise.  A crashed service stays dead until someone
starts it again.
