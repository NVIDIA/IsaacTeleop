# Sharpa Avatar plugin — agent notes

**CRITICAL:** Before editing this tree, read this file and the repo root
[`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md).

- **Keep the Avatar SDK external.** `install_avatar_sdk.sh` installs the
  official package under `/opt/avatar-sdk`; CMake consumes that fixed host
  layout directly. Do not copy, patch, or package SDK files, and do not
  advertise extracted SDK trees as supported.
- Install the latest candidate of the production `avatar-sdk` package; pin the
  channel, not a release number, and never substitute `-dev` or `-beta`.
- Keep installer responsibilities separate: SDK/APT in
  `install_avatar_sdk.sh`, host device permissions in
  `install_udev_rules.sh`, and plugin build/install orchestration in
  `install.sh`.
- Do not mutate loader environment variables or SDK configuration at runtime.
  Runtime paths come from the selected SDK root and its `sdk_config.json`.
- **Sample lives in `tools/`, not `examples/`.** Path is
  `src/plugins/sharpa_avatar/tools/sharpa_avatar_sample.py` (ticket #9). Do not
  put it back under `examples/sharpa_avatar`.
- **Public headers pull their dependencies into the interface.**
  `core/inc/avatar/device_side.hpp` is included by
  `avatar_hand_tracking_plugin.hpp`, so every consumer of
  `avatar_plugin_core` parses `AvatarSDK.h` and `openxr.h`. Keep those two link
  entries `PUBLIC` in `core/CMakeLists.txt`; demoting either to `PRIVATE`
  compiles the library but breaks `app/` and `tools/` with "fatal error: no such
  file or directory".
- **Bilateral behavior is table-driven, keyed by the enums, not by `if
  (left) / else`.** `DeviceSide {LEFT, RIGHT}` and `DeviceDataCategory {RAW,
  ROBOT, HUMAN}` in `core/inc/avatar/device_side.hpp` are the single source of
  truth for mapping to SDK enums, XR handles, collection ids, log labels, and
  per-side arrays. Add a case by extending a table (`kDeviceSides`,
  `kJointDataCategories`, `JointStreamRegistry`) — not by copy-pasting a second
  code path for the other hand. A literal `"left"`/`"right"` comparison
  outside that header means the enum round-trip was skipped.
- **Do not re-implement the wrist pose source.** Wrist placement
  (controller aim pose plus per-hand calibration, `XR_MNDX_xdev_space` optical
  hand tracking, and the runtime-specific xdev serial match) lives in
  `plugin_utils::WristPoseSource`. This plugin owns only `kHandOffsets` (its
  calibration) and the `DeviceSide` -> `plugin_utils::WristSide` conversion;
  any local `m_pfn_*`/`m_xdev_*` members or a second `is_openxr_extension_supported`
  mean the shared component was bypassed.
