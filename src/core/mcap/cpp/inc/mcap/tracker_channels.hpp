 * @tparam RecordT The FlatBuffer record wrapper stored in MCAP (e.g. HeadPoseRecord).
 *
 * Read-side counterpart to McapTrackerChannels. Owns an McapReader and iterates
 * all registered sub-channels through a single LinearMessageView. Each message is
 * verified and copied into a buffer the returned handle owns before the iterator
 * advances, because the underlying FileReader buffer is only valid until the next
 * read() call.
 *
 * When the iterator yields a message for a channel other than the one requested
 * by the caller, that handle is buffered in the corresponding ChannelBuffer and
 * returned on a subsequent read() for that channel index.
 *
 * Every schema the recording registers for these topics is checked against the binary
 * schema RecordT was generated from, so a recording written by a build with a different
 * `.fbs` is reported rather than silently misread (see schema_compat.hpp). The check runs
 * to completion in the constructor: a recording this build cannot decode is refused there,
 * which is what keeps a schema failure from surfacing part-way through a replay and leaves
 * read() with none of it to do. It needs the whole schema list up front (RecordedSchemas),
 * so a recording that cannot produce one is refused as well.
